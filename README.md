## What are those numbers?

All of these values are updated whenever you go to the next word (pressing space).

- The "_Speed_" value is your current speed (in WPM = Words Per Minute)
- The "_Keystrokes_" values are the number of keystrokes you hit. In green, the correct keystrokes and in red, the wrong keystrokes. On 10FF, when you typed a word wrong, all the keystrokes are considered wrong (even if you did just one mistake).
- The "_Score_" value is your current score (in WPM). If you stop the test, the score will be your final result. Your final result can not be less than the score.

## Languages supported

Here are the languages supported by the script:
- English
- Filipino
- French
- Indonesian
- Malagasy
- Malaysian

On other languages, the values displayed might not be accurate.

If you wish me to add keystrokes rules for your languages, feel free to create an issue or contact me on Discord.
