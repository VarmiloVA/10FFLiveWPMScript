## What are those numbers?

All of these values are updated whenever you go to the next word (pressing space).

- The "_Speed_" value is your current speed (in WPM = Words Per Minute)
- The "_Keystrokes_" values are the number of keystrokes you hit. In green, the correct keystrokes and in red, the wrong keystrokes. On 10FF, when you typed a word wrong, all the keystrokes are considered wrong (even if you did just one mistake).
- The "_Score_" value is your current score (in WPM). If you stop the test, the score will be your final result. Your final result can not be less than the score.

## Languages support

Currently, it only supports **English** and **French** normal+advanced tests, custom tests and competitions.

On other languages, the values displayed might not be accurate.
